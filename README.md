## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been a .NET engineer for over 7 years, specializing in the .NET ecosystem and platforms like Uno, MAUI, Avalonia UI, ASP.NET, Web API, and various UI frameworks. I also have significant expertise in core programming languages such as C/C++, Python, Rust, and other technologies. Recently, I've delved into modern advancements like AI Agents, large language models (LLMs), video streaming, multimedia processing, IPTV, networking, protocols, MCX, data analytics, and PDF manipulation using tools like MuPDF, iText, and ReportLab. In my spare time, I enjoy exploring coding innovations and staying up-to-date with the latest trends.
